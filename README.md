# Jina Park - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jina! I have recently completed my degree in Mathematics and Statistics. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

#### [Optimizing Concrete Aggregate Selection for Moisture Absorption](https://github.com/jinapark2150/Portfolio_Jina-Park/blob/c35875dad891693cb9c16fef21036cdb7c81f604/Optimizing%20Concrete%20Aggregate%20Selection%20for%20Moisture%20Absorption.R)
* **Purpose**: Determined the most effective concrete aggregate type in terms of moisture absorption, contributing to enhanced material performance in construction projects.
* **Role**: Led a team by assigning roles to members, coordinating meeting schedules, distributing reference materials, and maintaining a keen focus on project details.
* **Key Responsibilities**:
  + Developed and implemented R scripts to analyze data, including checking normality, assessing homogeneity of variances, conducting one-way ANOVA tests, and employing visualizations such as normal QQ plots and residual vs. predicted graphs.
  + Translated outcomes of each technique into comprehensive presentation slides for effective communication.
* **Technologies Used**: Normality checks, homogeneity assessments, one-way ANOVA tests, normal QQ plot graphs, residual vs. predicted graphs, and Tukey's HSD test.
* **Conclusions**:
  + Identified Type 4 as the most effective concrete aggregate with the least moisture absorption.
  + Found that Types 3 and 5 are not suitable alternatives due to significant differences.
  + Found that Types 1 and 2 can be considered as alternatives, despite Type 1 exhibiting great variation within groups; normality assumption is satisfied.

#### [The Effect of Different Doses of Caffeine on Endurance Performance]()
* **Description**: Conducted an analysis to investigate the correlation between caffeine dosage and individuals' endurance performance.
* **Roles and Responsibilities**:
  + Planned methodology to implement and executed R scripts, employing advanced statistical techniques with a focus on precision and reliability.
  + Collaborated with team members to translate outcomes of each technique used.
* **Technologies Used**: Normality checks, homogeneity assessments, two-way ANOVA tests, normal QQ plot graphs, residual vs. predicted graphs, and Tukey's HSD test for comparing doses means.
* **Conclusions**:
  + Established that there is a significant impact of caffeine intake on endurance performance, revealing that caffein effectively improves individuals; endurance capabiltiies.
  + Dosage of caffeine may noy be a significant effect, as Treatment 1 (0 mg) showed a marked difference from all other treatments according to the results of the Tukey HSD test.
  + Individual cyclists played a crucial role, as indicated by smaller p-values, highlighting that endurance performance variations are more pronounced among cyclists themselves. This emphasizes the personalized nature of the impact of caffeine on endurance.
