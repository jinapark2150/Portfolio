# Jina Park - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jina! I have recently completed my degree in Mathematics and Statistics. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

#### [Optimizing Concrete Aggregate Selection for Moisture Absorption](https://github.com/jinapark2150/Portfolio_Jina-Park/blob/c35875dad891693cb9c16fef21036cdb7c81f604/Optimizing%20Concrete%20Aggregate%20Selection%20for%20Moisture%20Absorption.R)
* Purpose: Determined the most effective concrete aggregate type in terms of moisture absorption, contributing to enhanced material performance in construction projects.
* Role: Led a team by assigning roles to members, coordinating meeting schedules, distributing reference materials, and maintaining a keen focus on project details.
* Key Responsibilities:
  + Developed and implemented R scripts to analyze data, including checking normality, assessing homogeneity of variances, conducting one-way ANOVA tests, and employing visualizations such as normal QQ plots and residual vs. predicted graphs.
  + Translated outcomes of each technique into comprehensive presentation slides for effective communication.
* Technologies Used:
  + Various statistical methods, including normality checks, homogeneity assessments, one-way ANOVA tests, normal QQ plot graphs, residual vs. predicted graphs, and Tukey's HSD test.
* Conclusions:
  + Identified Type 4 as the most effective concrete aggregate with the least moisture absorption.
  + Found that Types 3 and 5 are not suitable alternatives due to significant differences.
  + Found that Types 1 and 2 can be considered as alternatives, despite Type 1 exhibiting great variation within groups; normality assumption is satisfied.
