# Jina Park - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jina! I have recently completed my degree in Mathematics and Statistics. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

> [Optimizing Concrete Aggregate Selection for Moisture Absorption]([https://github.com/jinapark2150/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Project1%20-%20FINAL.R](https://github.com/jinapark2150/Portfolio/blob/main/Optimizing%20Concrete%20Aggregate%20Selection%20for%20Moisture%20Absorption))
* Purpose:
  + Determined the most effective concrete aggregate type in terms of moisture absorption, contributing to enhanced material performance in construction projects.
* Role:
  + Led a team by assigning roles to members, meticulously managing schedules to ensure optimal meeting attendance, and maintaining a keen focus on project details.
* Key Responsibilities:
  + Gathered raw data on various concrete aggregate types.
  + Developed and implemented R scripts to analyze data, including checking normality, assessing homogeneity of variances, conducting one-way ANOVA tests, and employing visualizations such as normal QQ plots and residual vs. predicted graphs.
  + Translated outcomes of each technique into comprehensive presentation slides for effective communication.
* Technologies Used:
  + Checking normality of each concrete mixture type.
  + Verifying homogeneity of variances.
  + Conducting one-way ANOVA tests for statistical analysis.
  + Generating normal QQ plots and residual vs. predicted graphs for data visualization.
  + Applied Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons of means.
* Significant Achievements or Outcomes:
  + Despite significant variation within groups for type 1 aggregate, successfully satisfied the normality assumption.
  + Identified type 4 aggregate as having the least moisture absorption, offering a valuable alternative for construction applications.
  + Provided insights into the suitability of various aggregate types, facilitating informed decision-making in construction material selection.
